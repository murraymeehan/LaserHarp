=========================
This app is a demo of Kinect data manipulation. 

It is intended to help students and tinkerers who want to start 
using Kinect-derived data in their favourite way, without having 
to learn about the whole openframeworks/openNI/openCV situation. 

<<<<<<< HEAD
To install the software prerequisites on Ubuntu 11.04 (should work on 10.04 as well):
	git clone git://github.com/murraymeehan/LaserHarp.git
	cd LaserHarp
	sudo ./Setup.Platform.sh # installs many, many things. Read this file to make sure you want them all!
Then to compile Laserharp:
	make
	#sudo make install # does nothing, currently
=======
You will need to setup openframeworks/openNI and have a Kinect.

The script "setup.sh" should take care of everything except getting a Kinect sensor, as long as you're using Ubuntu 11.04 32-bit Linux, as I am. 

It should all run on macosx/windows, but you will need to setup the stuff setup.sh takes care of on your own.

I hope you like it!
