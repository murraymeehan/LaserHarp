LaserHarp is a software and hardware design project by Murray Meehan, 
Ryan Derry, Kirsten Dohmeier, and Dan Kennedy at the University of 
Victoria for our January to April 2012 ELEC499 design project.

The code in this repository is written by Murray Meehan and works
hand in hand with the Marsyas plugin written by Ryan Derry. Ryan's
Marsyas plugin should be integrated into the Marsyas repository
in the near future, and in the meantime a simpler version is available
today using the OpenFrameworks ofSound library. It will also be 
uploaded to this repository as soon as a clean copy of the source code to
it can be found.

To run your very own laser harp, you will need:
1. A Kinect sensor
2. A computer running Linux, MacOSX, or Windows
3. Installed software (all free / open source):
	OpenNI Natural Interaction Toolkit
	NITE gesture tracking extension to OpenNI
	OpenFrameworks Creative Coding toolkit
	OpenFrameworks plugin: ofxOpenNI
	OpenFrameworks plugin: ofxMarsyas (https://github.com/murraymeehan/ofxMarsyas)

To install all software prerequisites on Ubuntu 11.04 (or possibly 10.04), try the install
script "Setup.Platform.sh". Your milage may vary, please report any problems because I 
would be happy to fix them.

Enjoy!
