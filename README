LaserHarp is a software and hardware design project by Murray Meehan, Ryan Derry, Kirsten Dohmeier, and Dan Kennedy at the University of Victoria, Canada for our January to April 2012 ELEC499 design project.

Prerequisities for running LaserHarp
1. Hardware:
	A Microsoft Kinect RGBD camera, version 1
	Laser display system (in early development)
2. Software
OpenFrameworks (includes ofxOpenCV)
OpenNI
OpenCV
ofxOpenNI
Marsyas

To install the software prerequisites on Ubuntu 11.04 (should work on 10.04 as well):
	git clone git://github.com/murraymeehan/LaserHarp.git
	cd LaserHarp
	sudo ./Setup.Platform.sh # installs many, many things. Read this file to make sure you want them all!
Then to compile Laserharp:
	make
	#sudo make install # does nothing, currently

Good Luck!
