=========================
This app is a demo of Kinect data manipulation. 

It is intended to help students and tinkerers who want to start 
using Kinect-derived data in their favourite way, without having 
to learn about the whole openframeworks/openNI/openCV situation. 

You will need to setup openframeworks/openNI and have a Kinect. 

The script "setup.sh" should take care of everything except getting a Kinect sensor, as long as you're using Ubuntu 11.04 32-bit Linux, as I am. 

It should all run on macosx/windows, but you will need to setup the stuff setup.sh takes care of on your own.

I hope you like it!
